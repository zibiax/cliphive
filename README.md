# Cliphive

Go project to do something similar to pastebin, then we'll see were it goes.

Using mostly core modules. But also these so far:  
```
github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.8.1
github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter v1.3.0
github.com/justinas/alice v1.2.0
github.com/go-playground/form
```

Would like to use svelte for frontend, because it seems like a good js framework that compiles it to its barebones js for good performance :hammer:
